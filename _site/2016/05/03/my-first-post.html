<h1>Creating a Blog Using Jekyll</h1>
<p>May 03, 2016</p>
<p>I will be documenting the processes necessary to create a blog post using Jekyll.
  This will be considerded my first post, but I will be mainly focused on the styling of these
  pages instead of the actual blog content.  I need to dedicate time to the art of front-end
  design, mastering HTML and CSS markup languages.  These can be rather tedious processes, but
  I'm assured that the more time devoted to this skill and experience with writing in these languages
  that it will go better in future iterations/usages.
</p>

<p>After installing the Jekyll gem, I am able to use the command "jekyll serve" to begin running
  my website via a local host socket, as well as auto-generating a _site folder that contains my posts
  and stylings
